  My favorite types of beer are IPAs and Imperial Stouts.</p>
  <p>
  Below you'll find my favorite examples of each type.
  </p>

  <div id="subheader">
  <h2>IPA</h2>
  </div>
  <p title="Sure, Colonialism sucked, but the beer they invented is so good...">
  An IPA, or 'India Pale Ale' is a hoppy pale ale, usually with a higher bitterness and alcohol content than the average pale ale. Supposedly, the name derives from the Colonial Era, when British troops were making long voyages to India. They would load their brews with hops and alcohol to mask the off-flavors inherent to beer that has been unrefridgerated for months.
  </p>

  <div id="Lagunitas">

  <h3><u>Lagunitas - IPA</u></h3>
  <p>
  <img id="IPA" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSVDj0UJDwEwO7s-3bbltZ7lFsStAJJfoXW9G0Z2NWIzBEo56EuGw"> My favorite 'go-to' IPA is simply called "IPA" from Lagunitas Brewery in Petaluma, CA. Brewed using a good about of hops, this beer is a quintessential IPA. With a new location in Chicago, distribution to the East Coast has improved. Beer lovers rejoice.

  <div id="subheader1">
  <h2>Imperial Stout</h2>
  </div>

  <p title="Вкусный, нет?">
  That's right, not just a stout, but an IMPERIAL stout. Imperial beers get their name from the days when England used to brew beer for the Russian Czar's court. In efforts to please the royalty the beers were extra BOLD tasting, full-bodied and with higher than normal alcohol content.  
  </p>


  <div id="Stout">
  <h3><u>Other Half - Smoke Screens and Oil Slicks</u></h3>
     <p><img id="oilslick" style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_250,c_limit/beer_310144.jpg"> If you are ready for a life-changing beer, seek out the rare Smoke Screens and Oil Slicks brewed by none other than my favorite brewery, Other Half in Gowanus, Brooklyn. This smokey, smooth stout is full-bodied, with flavors of coffee, chocolate, and smoke.</p>
