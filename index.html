My favorite types of beer are IPAs and Russian Imperial Stouts. Below you'll find some recommendations of classic examples of these varieties as well as some that are harder to find but worth seeking out!

<h2>IPA</h2>
</div>

<p title="Sure, Colonialism sucked, but the beer they invented is so good...">
An IPA, or 'India Pale Ale' is a hoppy pale ale, usually with a higher bitterness and alcohol content than the average pale ale. Supposedly, the name derives from the Colonial Era, when British troops were making long voyages to India. They would load their brews with hops and alcohol to mask the off-flavors inherent to beer that has been unrefridgerated for months.
</p>

<h3>Classic</h3>
<p>
My favorite 'go-to' IPA is simply called <a href="https://lagunitas.com/beer/ipa"> "IPA" </a> from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lagunitas+Brewing+Company/@39.8717421,-110.2973596,5z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sLagunitas!3m4!1s0x8085b4fa71fc2dc1:0xb26a1d2fc74f87c!8m2!3d38.2726885!4d-122.6623535">Lagunitas Brewery</a> in Petaluma, CA. Brewed using a good about of hops, this beer is a quintessential IPA. With a new location in Chicago, distribution to the east coast has improved. Beer lovers rejoice.

<h3>Elusive</h3>
<p>
Available only for only two weeks every year, the awe-inspiring <a href="https://russianriverbrewing.com/pages/pliny-the-younger"> Pliny the Younger </a> is brewed by <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Russian+River+Brewing+Company/@38.441804,-122.713836,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808447fdcd1c3235:0x70372ccdef58e9f!8m2!3d38.441804!4d-122.711642">Russian River Brewery</a> in Santa Rosa, CA.This is a triple IPA which means it has a very high alcohol content of 10.25%. to say that it tastes like fresh gold from a friendly leprachaun would be an understatement. If you can't acheive the dream, <a href="https://russianriverbrewing.com/pages/pliny-the-elder"> Pliny the Elder </a> is a double IPA that is available year-round

<h2>Imperial Stout</h2>
</div>

<p title="Вкусный, нет?">
That's right, not just a stout, but an IMPERIAL stout. Imperial beers get their name from the days when England used to brew beer for the Russian Czar's court. In efforts to please the royalty the beers were extra BOLD tasting, full-bodied and with higher than normal alcohol content.
</p>

<h3>Classic</h3>
<p>
For a classic example of this style, I recommend a good <a href="https://northcoastbrewing.com/beers/year-round-beers/old-rasputin-russian-imperial-stout/?ao_confirm"> Old Rasputin</a>. Produced in Fort Bragg, CA by <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/North+Coast+Brewing+Company/@39.4463672,-123.8056428,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xdf44a879824a0642!8m2!3d39.4463672!4d-123.8056428"> North Coast Brewery</a>, this beer is slightly sweet at first with a deep, roasted chocolatey finish. Despite being from the isolated Northern CA coast, it is widely distributed and easy to find in any craft beer store.
